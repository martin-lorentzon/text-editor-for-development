# Clean Blender Add-on Template
## Complete structure â€¢ Reloadable in Blender â€¢ Formatted with autopep8

A commented template for multifile add-on development that is fully compliant with the Blender Extensions platform.  
The project is very minimal by design.

I suggest placing your add-on inside of a [script directory](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/file_paths.html#script-directories) for ease of use.  
The script directory may be placed inside of your local Github directory.
```
Github/
â”œâ”€â”€ Blender/ (script directory)
â”‚      â””â”€â”€ addons/
â”‚            â””â”€â”€ epic-legendary-addon/
```
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to install your newly created script directory in Blender Preferences > File Paths > Script Directories

* Ability to reload in Blender with `bpy.ops.script.reload()`
